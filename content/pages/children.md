        title: The Interdimensional Crime Fighting Meerkats of Almost Certain Peril 1
        text: >+
          In a time similar to your own, inside a parallel reality which is
          shifted

          slightly to the left...


          ...in England, near the top, on the west hand

          side, there is a zoo…


          ...and a little way north of that zoo, up in

          the hills, is a wind turbine…


          ...and under that turbine, in a secret base,

          live the Inter-dimensional, Crime

          Fighting Meerkats of Almost Certain Peril.
