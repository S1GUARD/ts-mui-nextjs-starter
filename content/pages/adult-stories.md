        title: Poor Choice For A Champion
        text: >+
          It is a time of celebration and joy. The war is won and the King of
          Death is defeated.


          But for the Lich Lord, Nemeddes, death is merely an inconvenience and
          in a moment of brutal cunning, he sways the tide of battle back into
          his favour. Once more his dark host marches on the free lands of
          Ostus. This time no army can best it. The Darkness is ascendant and
          all the Light can offer as champion is a cowardly farm hand unable to
          even wield a sword.


          Yet this farm hand is not alone, three great heroes ride with him and
          he possesses the one thing that can stop the Lich…

        title: A Darkness Within Darkness
        text: >+
          It is a time of darkness and dread. The strong crush the weak and
          witchcraft and necromancy swell unchecked. The Cusp, the partition
          that separates our world from what is beyond, has grown thin and
          threadbare. In the older, darker places of the world, it has already
          collapsed. Demons and spirits pour through and ancient things that
          once stalked and hunted man, long banished by champions of old, are
          returning.


          Through this chaos one man walks, joyous in slaughter and death:
          Ahriman - the Dark Rider. Thrice a king by his own hand, he is a cruel
          and wilful killer; cunning, heartless and immune to compassion.


          But now Ahriman is dying. Desperate for a cure he journeys into the
          forsaken, frozen North. At his back, he is pursued by the scores of
          enemies he has made through his evil life. Bandits, brigands, knights
          and kings all hunt him. But what is that to Ahriman? He has always
          been hunted.


          In the North there is something worse; the armies of Yebzor, the Witch
          of the Hill - and beyond her, something vile and ancient... something
          dread and all powerful which awakens from long slumber. In time this
          ancient entity will lash all of humanity in chains. It is corrupt and
          perverse beyond human understanding and it is completely unused to
          defiance or defeat.


          But then, in all its long life, it has never faced an enemy like
          Emal-Na'rad Ahriman...

          Our world is nearly done. Mankind has killed her.


          On the surface of The Heat, the great desert that is all that is left,
          the last generation of humanity struggles beneath an unforgiving sun.
          But even in the very end times there are those who still seek power.
          The remnants of the great corporations who brought about our downfall
          still seek to control the lives of those who remain.


          Resources that should go to humanitarian aid go to war machines, money
          that could end suffering is spent on mercenaries and technology that
          could save thousands of lives is reserved only for the elite. But
          there are still those who resist, who cling to the hope of tomorrow -
          rebels and outcasts who will do anything for the technological secrets
          that could save their people.


          This is a story of the the end times, of heroes and sacrifice and an
          old man called Jekk who is too stubborn to die…

        title: The Writer
        text: >+
          Simon Scotts was coldly happy living in his brother’s shadow. His
          brother might have been on the back page each week scoring a winning
          goal or plastered across the front pages with his latest girlfriend -
          but Simon was well used to that. And even if Simon’s own dreams had
          never come true, he had his own life, his own family, his own career.
          And that was enough.


          Until the story broke.


          There’s no easy way to find out you’re a cuckold. But when your
          brother is an international sports star and the press are desperate to
          cover every aspect about his affair with your wife - there is no where
          to hide.


          But from the unwanted attention of that nightmare comes a chance, a
          last chance, for all Simon’s dreams to come true: to be famous, to be
          respected and finally to be more than the other brother.


          But all dreams come with a price.

          On an unlicensed world far into deep space, away from the prying eyes
          of the Mega Corps and Galactic Governors, stands The Tower: a hub for
          the sort of research that needs doing when whatever needs doing has to
          stay off the books.


          Inside: a hive of minds all working on the next big thing - illegal
          weapons, immoral tech, bio-warfare, occult investigations, intelligent
          design - and the pinnacle of it all; research that could rewrite every
          axiom that humankind has ever held: Project Beacon.


          But now The Tower has gone dark. Its defences are down, its personnel
          are slaughtered - and all its data - including Project Beacon - is up
          for grabs.


          This is the story of the brave men and women who would be scarified to
          this end, and to the one man who survived when no other’s could - the
          man at the top of The Tower.
